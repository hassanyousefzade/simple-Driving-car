## description

It uses the OpenNI library to capture depth and RGB streams from a device, such as a camera. The code then performs various image processing operations to detect a specific color range in the RGB image.
Once the color range is detected, the code finds the contours of the objects in the image and calculates their areas, perimeters, and minimum enclosing circles. It also determines the orientation of the circles based on their x-coordinates and calculates the difference in radii and y-coordinates.
The code then calculates the angle of rotation based on the difference in y-coordinates and sends commands to a connected serial port. The commands control a robotic system,   to perform actions based on the detected objects and their properties.
