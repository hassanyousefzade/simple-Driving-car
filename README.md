# simple-driving-car
## intoduction
The purpose of building a very simple self-driving car in the form of a robot is to create a practical project. It is possible to add better capabilities and considerations in controlling the robot, as well as its features.
## Problem Description
This robot is intended to be an extremely simple self-driving car. Therefore, we consider two lines drawn with a wire as the environment of a street, where the robot is supposed to keep itself in the middle of these two lines and not deviate.

## Components and used equipment
In this project, as expected and shown in the accompanying video, there is a robot with four wheels. We have used four 12V DC motors (although it could have been done with two motors and two axles, which would have allowed us to utilize sensors in the wheels and achieve higher precision). Furthermore, we have utilized a structure as the robot's body, which was designed and fabricated using software. Additionally, we have used a 360 XBOX Kinect as a camera and a distance sensor. The reason for choosing this equipment is its ability to provide stereo vision, as it has two cameras that can measure distance accurately.
Of course, this device has many capabilities that can be utilized. It is beyond the scope of this discussion, and one can search for it on the internet. Additionally, the Arduino Nano has been used as the robot controller.
